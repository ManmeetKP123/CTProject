# CTProject
This repository is part of the CT project completed in summer 2022. This project involved making a segmentation net for 3D dataset of tumour affected lymph nodes. 
This was accomplished by creating a UNet and the dataset used can be obtained from the TCIA website (CT Lymph Nodes dataset).
